# jQuery and Events

**Author**: Joy Hou, Garrett Johnson, and Joe Waine
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog application that filters entries by author or category and also toggles the length of the entries depending on whether or not the user wants to read past the snippets. We're building this to gain a greater understanding of jQuery.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone from the base code. Switch into a working branch.
2. Add stylesheets, .eslintrc.json and .gitignore. Link articleView.
3. Complete the functions in articleView and call them.
4. ACP

## Architecture
We're using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As well as jQuery and normalize.css.
